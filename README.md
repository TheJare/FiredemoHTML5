This is a direct port of my old Firedemo effect.
Made to celebrate the 20th anniversary :)

See it in action at http://www.iguanademos.com/Jare/files/Fire/

Works great in IE9+, Firefox 20+ (Win and Android) and iOS Safari.
Chrome on both Win and Android is rather slow, not sure why.
Android Dolphin only updates a subrect of the canvas.
